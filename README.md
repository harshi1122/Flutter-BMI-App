Flutter BMI App

I have started learning Flutter recently and this is my first app. It's a BMI calculator that allows you to input your gender, height as well as weight and provides you with your BMI. 

I used the design of Mr. Ruben Vaalt (https://dribbble.com/shots/4585382-Simple-BMI-Calculator). Really looking forward to learning more and designing better apps.
